            Hello! I'm Melih Doğan, fresh graduate from Management Information Systems at Boğaziçi University. I'm a strong team player who is able to quickly learn from his fellows and seniors.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">My path with coding crossed first when I was a freshman but I did not delve into it back then. Afterwards, I had the opportunity of attending front-end web development bootcamp in 2020. In 5-months-long intensive training focusing on JS and React, I also participated various team and solo projects. Then I took a break for a while but I didn't idle around afterward, of course. While I was exploring the start-up and entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey during my project assistant time in Yıldız Technopark, I took courses in various fields such as security, cloud computing, and mobile application development at the college.</p>
